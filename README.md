# ETF Selection Guide

A practical, plain-English checklist for choosing **and managing** exchange-traded funds (ETFs).  
Numbers below are rough guidelines, not hard rules.

---

## 1. Pick a Broad Index  

| What to check | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| Broad “core” indexes like **MSCI World**, **FTSE All-World**, **S&P 500**, **STOXX Europe 600**, or **DAX**. | They hold hundreds of companies, so one bad sector hurts less. |
| Avoid narrow “theme” indexes (e.g. only space tourism). | A fad can fade fast, cutting returns. |

---

## 2. Spread Across Countries  

| What to check | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| Try to keep any single country below **≈ 25 %** of the fund. | A crisis in one country will not dominate your portfolio. |
| Aim for the top three countries together below **≈ 60 %**. | Adds another layer of safety. |

---

## 3. Spread Across Sectors and Companies  

| What to check | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| No single sector (tech, banks, energy, etc.) above **≈ 30 %**. | Protects you from sector-specific shocks. |
| No single company above **≈ 10 %**. | Limits the effect of one firm’s bad news. |

---

## 4. Minimise Overlap Between ETFs  

| What to check | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| If you hold several ETFs, look up their **top 10 holdings** or use free “overlap” tools. | Buying many funds that own the **same** stocks defeats diversification. |
| Keep any shared holding weight small (≤ 5 % of total portfolio is a common target). | Lower overlap means wider spread of risk. |

---

## 5. Fund Domicile (Legal Home)  

| What to check | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| For German investors, **Ireland** or **Luxembourg** domiciles are tax-friendly. | They reduce foreign dividend tax and simplify paperwork. |
| Avoid U.S.–domiciled funds unless you understand the 30 % withholding tax. | Higher tax can quietly cut returns. |

---

## 6. Currency Risk  

| What to check | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| **Fund currency** (price quotation) and **asset currency** (where companies earn). | If both are in euro, exchange rates add little extra swing. |
| Unhedged dollar or pound funds move with EUR-USD or EUR-GBP rates. | Adds potential gain _or_ pain. |

---

## 7. Fund Size & Liquidity  

| What to check | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| Assets under management (AUM) ≥ **€ 500 M**. | Large funds are unlikely to shut down. |
| Daily trading value ≥ **€ 1 M** on Xetra (or main venue). | Easier, cheaper to buy and sell. |

---

## 8. Replication Method  

| What to check | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| Prefer **physical replication** (the fund owns real shares). | Simple, transparent, fewer hidden risks. |
| Accept **synthetic** only if it clearly lowers cost and has strong collateral. | Swaps add complexity. |

---

## 9. Fund Age  

| What to check | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| ≥ **5 years** history (≥ 3 years is fine if tracking is tight). | Shows it can do its job in good and bad markets. |

---

## 10. Cost & Tracking  

| What to check | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| **TER** (total expense ratio) ≤ **0.20 %** for large developed-market indexes. | High fees eat returns. |
| **Tracking difference** ≤ **0.50 %** per year. | Measures how well the fund mirrors its index _after_ all costs. |

---

## 11. Dividend Policy  

| What to check | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| **Accumulating** share class (dividends reinvested). | Slightly more tax efficient in Germany; no manual reinvestment. |
| **Distributing** share class (dividends paid out). | Good if you want regular cash. |

---

## 12. Risk Indicators  

| What to check | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| Annual **volatility** and worst past drop (drawdown). | Lower numbers mean a smoother ride. |
| Compare to a broad index you accept as a risk yardstick. | Helps you avoid panic-selling. |

---

## 13. Portfolio Allocation  

| What to check | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| Decide stock-bond split that matches your **risk comfort**, **goal**, and **time horizon**. | Example: 95 % stocks / 5 % bonds for a 20-year goal. |
| Higher stock share = higher ups and downs but larger long-term growth potential. | Fit the mix to your personal situation. |

---

## 14. Rebalancing  

| What to check | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| Review allocations at least once a year or after big market moves. | Keeps risk in line with your plan. |
| If stocks soar and your 95 %/5 % mix becomes 98 %/2 %, sell some stocks (or buy bonds) to restore the target. | Prevents hidden risk creep. |

---

## 15. Extra Costs to Remember  

| What to check | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| Broker commissions, account fees, bid-ask spreads. | Small drips add up. |
| German **Vorabpauschale** (advance tax) on funds. | Brokers usually handle it, but it affects cash flow. |
